h2. nscp -- Nagios SSH Command Pipe

The purpose of this project is to allow a Nagios server to run active checks on a remote system, without requiring
# unencrypted data transfer or
# dozens to hundreds of SSH connections each hour.

It does that by running a small bash script on the machine to be monitored, which communicates with the server solely by using named pipes (or FIFOs).

Unfortunately, it doesn't work really well yet, sometimes the connection just hangs.
I don't have the time to care about this project any more, but wanted to share the code to anybody who's interested in developing the idea further.
